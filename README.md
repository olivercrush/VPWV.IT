# VPWV.IT (REACT VERSION)
VPWV.IT is an image processing webapp. It allows the user to apply effects on images (such as chromatic abberation or greyscale).

This is the second iteration of my [vaporwaveit](https://github.com/olivercrush/vaporwaveit) project. This time, I choose ReactJS for the frontend library and Flask for the backend library. The reason behind this is I want to have a full React product on my portfolio and develop my image processing algorithms in python.

## Effects currently available in this version
Here are the effects that are developped right now :
- Greyscale

## The future
Here is a quickpeak at the features coming :
- More effects : chromatic abberation, pixel sorting
- Integration in electron, creation of an install/startup script
